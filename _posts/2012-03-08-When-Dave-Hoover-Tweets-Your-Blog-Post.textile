OMFG! 250 page views! So exciting!

Hmm, maybe I should dig deeper. Oh, yep, there it is. Avg time on site, 1.38 minutes.

But you know what Des McHale says about "averages":http://www.quotegarden.com/statistics.html.

I dug a little deeper, and it looks as though somewhere between 10 and 15 people read all or most of the post:

Two valuable lessons from all this:

1. Reflecting on your experiences is good. About 5% of those who view the post found it useful in some way, and those who didn't, bounced fast.

2. It's easy to miss the metric that really matters. Dig deeper.

Stories can be good to drive traffic, but have some other content that's actually helpful. Tutorials maybe? "Walkthroughs":http://koriroys.com/2012/02/21/Guard-Livereload.html? Links to my "sister's artwork":http://finefractals.com?
