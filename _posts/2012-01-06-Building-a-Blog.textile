This site/blog look absolutely horrible. Partially because I have no clue how to design a website. Mostly because rather than keep this thing wrapped up on my machine, I want to get it out there looking terrible and be motivated to fix it as I go.  Also, I want to build it myself, rather than doing lots of copying and pasting from other people.

I figured out how to host a site on github a few weeks back, but decided that with "Code Academy":http://www.codeacademy.org looming near, I wanted a place where I could blog. But I wanted to build the blog myself. Since I have not built much of anything (useful) before, the going is pretty slow. But each little victory makes the glacial pace worth it. I figure just hack something together, learn a bunch, then do it right (and 90% faster) then second time around.

A few details about the site: This is a site hosted by "Github Pages":http://pages.github.com. When I push to github it is run through Jekykll, and a static site gets spit out the other end. I am oversimplifying I know, but so far that is my understanding of it.
